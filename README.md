This is where I put some thoughts regarding programming stuff.

## 21 May 2020 - getint()
I felt like creating a C/C++ function which can read integers from the input buffer and has a good management of invalid input. Then I created `getint()` using [`getchar()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/getchar).

After creating it, I have been told that there are quite a number of similar functions existing already. But still I decided to put it here.

I could have written more about it. When I have time, I think I will do it.

When you find bugs or areas of improvement, please feel free to point them out.
