# getint(): An inspiration

I felt like creating a C/C++ function which can read integers from the input buffer and has a good management of invalid input. Then I created `getint()` using [`getchar()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/getchar).

After creating it, I have been told that there are quite a number of similar functions existing already. But still I decided to put it here.

You can find more about it in my [blog post](https://zhongruoyu.github.io/projects/2020-05/getint/).
